# react-faceplate

This is my personal react component library. I found that I like to use the same
simple UI components in various projects. While there are UI libraries out there,
there are complicated to use, documentation is lacking, and often come with a lot
of issues. While they serve perfectly well some projects, I like to stick with something simpler.

This library contains very simple components that come with some default styles
and behaviors.
